BACKGROUND
---
There are organizations that manufacture and sell MRI-safe response devices for subjects undergojng research MRI scans. [Current Designs](https://www.curdes.com) is one such corporation that makes the highest quality devices. Unforunately, the form factor makes these devices uncomfortable to hold for long periods of time and is not conducive to holding in such a way that is familiar to kids who might be familiar with game controllers. This repo contains the resoucres necessary to fabricate a wrap-around holder for Curent Designs devices while providing the desirable form factor. 

DESIGN
---
Meant to mimic the handles common to popular game console controllers, this holder is designed to provide an ergonomic way to hold the response device. In some situations, where only a few buttons are required for interaction, it could even subsitute for the [Current Designs Gamepad2 device](https://www.curdes.com/mainforp/responsedevices/variabledevices/gamepad2.html) at considerably lower cost. 

This has been tested with these [CurDes Response devices](https://www.curdes.com/mainforp/responsedevices/buttonboxes.html):
* 4 Button Inline
* 4 Button Curve Right
* 4 Button Curve Left
* 8 Button Bimanual Curved Lines
* 8 Button Bimanual Straight lines

DESCRIPTION
---
Although this holder could theoretically be printed with a garden variety FDM 3D printer (assuming it has a large enough build stage), cleaning and disinfection routines necessary between individual subjects might cause accelerated wear. Additionally, the surface texture of FDM prints isn't what I would think most poeple are comfortable holding. Instead, it is recommended that this holder be printed on either a SLS or SLA printer. 
I have used both, and they have both produced more thatn acceptable results. The SLS version was printed with nylon material, and the finished surface (shown in the photos) was micro-textured and provided an excellent grip. However, that texture does make it more difficult to clean as it grips TDI wipes, which are commonly used in the MRI setting. The SLA prints, on the other hand, yield almost perfectly smooth surfaces - similar to injection molded parts. The next time I need to print one of these, I will use an SLA printer.


FABRICATION 
---
There are numerous services available that can print this part. I recommend nylon material for SLS printers and an engineering or "tough" resin for SLA printers. Costs can vary widely, but in January, 2023, I had this printed using SLA and including shipping, the cost was only $167. Compared to the alternatives, that was a bargain!
